Model Facets
============

Small utilities for Eclipse-based modeling, inspired by the Ruby facets library (https://github.com/rubyworks/facets).
These utilities can be installed independently and are intended to facilitate one (and only one) of the typically
annoying tasks.

So far:
 * Convert textual resource (e.g., Xtext, EMFText) into XMI file.
 * Register meta-model. 

Planned:
 * List of registered meta-models.
 * Convert ATL transformation files to XMI and back. Useful to experiment with Higher Order Transformations.

Suggestions?
